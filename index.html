				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>My mum sparked my interest in IT because my mum is currently working in IT.</br>
			Hence Iâ€™ve been through 1 week of work experience in 2015 at her workplace. I saw there was a need of women in the workplace as it was mainly male dominant.</br> 
			This was not the only reason I wanted to do IT, the main reason was that IT is part of the future and still is to this day.</br> 
			IT is essential was banking, flight reservations, e-commerce websites and business, etc. In a nutshell, IT is part of every workplace in a big or small way. 
			My interest in IT is managing IT projects or programs for a company because I have good leadership skills and good people skills to lead the team.</p> 
			<p>I chose to enroll in RMIT, as it is a well-known university recognised in the innovation of IT. I have also been to the RMIT city campus during my Year 10 excursion where I saw the lecture rooms and the facilities on campus. I was amazed at how modern and clean the building was, also the location was convenient for me as there is easy access to public transport and in the heart of Melbourne.</p>
			<p>I expect to learn the basics of programming such as JAVA language and using Eclipse which is a program to use JAVA language in, how to design a user-friendly product or system so that it is efficient and effective for customers or users, understand the IT project management principles, how to manage or lead a team, how to stand out from a crowd of applicants in an interview, and get a better understanding on what my future job will be like.</p>
