				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>My mum sparked my interest in IT because my mum is currently working in IT. Hence Iâ€™ve been through 1 week of work experience in 2015 at her workplace.</p>
			<p>I saw there was a need of women in the workplace as it was mainly male dominant.</p>
			<p>This was not the only reason I wanted to do IT, the main reason was that IT is part of the future and still is to this day.</p> 
			<p>IT is essential was banking, flight reservations, e-commerce websites and business, etc. In a nutshell, IT is part of every workplace in a big or small way.</p>
			<p>My interest in IT is managing IT projects or programs for a company because I have good leadership skills and good people skills to lead the team.</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
